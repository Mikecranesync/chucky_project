This outline details the technical steps and file structure required to build and execute programmed AI agent workflows using Claude Code, focusing exclusively on the mechanics described in the sources.

## Comprehensive Outline of Claude Code Programming Workflow

### I. Environment Setup and Installation

A. **Tool Selection and Requirement:** Claude Code is preferred as the core AI agent tool, comparable to mainline AI coding tools like Cursor.
B. **Installation Command:** To install Claude Code, the user must navigate to `enthropic.com/cloudcode` and paste the provided command into the terminal.
C. **Execution Environment:** Claude Code is designed to run in **any terminal**.
    1.  The demonstrated setup utilizes Cursor (a fork of VS Code) as the development environment.
    2.  Running the agent inside the development environment allows the user to observe the code running as it is being built.
D. **Launching the Agent:** Once installed, the user types **`claude`** into the terminal and hits enter to activate the AI agent.

### II. Defining Context and File Structure

A. **Master Directory Creation:** A new folder must be created on the computer (e.g., in the Documents folder) to serve as the master directory for the Life OS.
B. **Local Context Inclusion:** The master directory must contain local files that provide context for the agents.
C. **Context File Format:** All contextual files necessary for the workflows must be **markdown files**.
D. **Example Context Setup (Newsletter Researcher):**
    1.  Create a specific folder within the master directory (e.g., a `newsletter` folder).
    2.  Create a markdown file within that folder (e.g., `newsletter links.mmd`).
    3.  Paste the relevant links (e.g., competitor newsletter URLs) into the `newsletter links.mmd` file.
E. **Data Input Example (Brain Dump Analysis):** A folder is set up for daily notes and ideas, written as markdown files, which the agent scans for patterns.

### III. System Prompting and Automated Agent Configuration

A. **Defining the Master Prompt:** A master prompt must be formulated to instruct Claude Code on the specific system or slash command to build (e.g., "create a newsletter research system that analyzes competitor newsletters and writes drafts").
    1.  *Alternative Prompt Generation:* The user can ask Claude to build the prompt for the sub-agents and slash command structure itself, leveraging Claude's creativity.
B. **Triggering System Generation:** The master prompt is copied and pasted directly into the active Claude Code terminal.
C. **Autonomous Structure Building:** Upon receiving the master prompt, Claude Code automatically begins to build its own necessary structure.
    1.  **Directory Construction:** It builds its own directory for **commands** and a directory for **sub agents**.
    2.  **Slash Command Definition:** It builds the custom slash command (e.g., `/newsletter researcher`). The slash command exists as a markdown file inside the commands directory.
    3.  **Sub-Agent Definition:** It builds necessary specialized sub-agents (e.g., a content researcher sub agent and a newsletter writer sub agent).
D. **Internal Prompting/Configuration:** Claude Code integrates external context to configure the sub-agents.
    1.  It reads the user's provided context (e.g., past newsletters) to determine their specific "voice" and style.
    2.  It uses this analysis to write its own detailed instructions and structures (prompts) for the sub-agents, effectively "prompt[ing] itself to build its own structure".

### IV. Workflow Execution and Data Output

A. **Command Execution:** To run the automated workflow, the user types the custom slash command (e.g., `/newsletter researcher` or `/daily brief`) into the terminal and hits enter.
B. **Sub-Agent Activation:** The slash command "spin[s] up a sub agent" to perform the defined tasks.
C. **Data Processing Tools:**
    1.  The agent uses its built-in **web searching tool** to read the internet, scrape websites, fetch and analyze posts, and find current news without needing pre-fed publication links.
    2.  The agent analyzes patterns across contextual files (e.g., scanning 30 days of brain dumps for recurring themes).
D. **Output Generation:** The resulting content (e.g., newsletter draft, subject lines, priority updates, industry trends) is created and saved to a designated folder (e.g., a folder containing drafts).
    1.  Outputs are often structured (e.g., the Weekly Dashboard output is well-structured and visible when opened in a tool like Obsidian).
